# Grammar_Scoring_Engine

This project aims to develop a Grammar Scoring Engine that processes spoken audio samples and predicts a continuous grammar score (ranging from 0 to 5). The system uses audio feature extraction techniques, including MFCC (Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients), and machine learning models, such as XGBoost and RandomForestRegressor, to assess grammar accuracy in spoken language.
